Pattern Grammar
===============

The grammar ended up being a bit more convoluted than I originally planned, as I compromised between
legibility and ease of implementation.

Basically, an expression is a list of tokens delimited by spaces.

@$arg1 signifies that the token is an argument named arg1, of type string ($). Arguments are named to aid in mapping them, 
and are typed so the instruction parsing can know what types of tokens to expect there. They won't be used with widgets, 
so in the case of actions the arguments will map to target widgets and types of controls.

Quantity modifiers are done in prefix notation, and are inspired by :
?...) = query = 0 or 1 times
*...) = star = 0 or more times
+...) = plus = 1 or more times
|a,b,) = pipe = a or b

In the case of a pipe/selection, sub-expressions (including sequences otherwise delimited with spaces) are
surrounded by brackets: [subexpr]. Also notice that there needs to be a trailing comma.

In a bracketed subexpression, all spaces are replaced with underscores: [a_b].

NOTES:
	- ... means repetition
	- null means the pattern graph required a null node to represent a selection or loop point, but which is not
	  associated with any token
	- this graph is a very primitive representation used only for debugging
